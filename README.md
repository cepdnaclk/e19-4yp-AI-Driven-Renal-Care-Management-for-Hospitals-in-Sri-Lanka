## Abstract

<p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a growing burden in Sri Lanka. This project aims to develop an <b>AI-powered expert system</b> to assist in the management of hemodialysis patients at the Teaching Hospital Peradeniya. The system provides real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and clinical decision support. By digitizing medical records and integrating advanced AI tools, it aims to improve patient outcomes, reduce complications, and enhance treatment personalization.</p>

## Problem Statement

Traditional dialysis monitoring is manual, reactive, and prone to delays in detecting complications. With limited medical infrastructure in Sri Lanka, the need for scalable, intelligent systems is high. This project introduces an AI-driven approach to enable proactive care, address model adaptability challenges, and improve clinical trust through explainable AI (XAI).

## Objectives

### General Objective
To develop and validate an AI expert system that enhances dialysis management through real-time monitoring and predictive support.

### Specific Objectives

- Develop an ensemble ML model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN.
- Identify essential clinical and demographic data for accurate predictions.
- Compare the AI system with traditional care models in terms of outcomes.
- Build an integrated expert system with a user-friendly clinical dashboard.
- Pilot the system at Teaching Hospital Peradeniya and gather clinical feedback.
